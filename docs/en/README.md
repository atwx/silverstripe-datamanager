# Documentation

Add your documentation in the `docs/en/` folder as markdown. Note the "en/" part of the path refers to the language (English in this case) used in the documentation you provide.
If your documentation is vast, you can split it into many markdown files and sub folders.

Look over the [guidance on documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/documentation/)

Make sure to remove this readme in your actual module!
