# Entwine wrappers

Put any Entwine wrappers in here to render React components in non-React controlled areas, or
to interact with parts of the Silverstripe CMS that are not React driven yet.

See the [Silverstripe CMS enwtine documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/customising_the_admin_interface/jquery_entwine/)

Make sure to remove this readme in your actual module!
