# JavaScript bundles

Put your bundle.js file here, pointing to your boot files and legacy scripts.

See the [Silverstripe CMS javascript documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/customising_the_admin_interface/javascript_development/)

Make sure to remove this readme in your actual module!
